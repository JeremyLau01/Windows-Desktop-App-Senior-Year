# Windows-Desktop-App-Senior-Year


Todo App for Windows:
In my senior year of high school, I made a Windows Desktop Application for my final project for English class. This was my passion project for the public speaking course. 

Download "WpfTry3.exe" to test out the build for yourself. Features include:
- Adding single line todo items
- Adding multi line todo items
- Ability to edit current todo items
- Calming background image
- Accurate current date of the month and year
- Dynamically scaling app interface when resizing the window
- Custom minimize and close buttons
- Hand-drawn smiley face taskbar app icon

[YouTube Video Demonstration](https://youtu.be/Xr-4ZGVtyss) which shows that the app works as intended and gives an example of someone using the app.

"Jeremy Lau - TED Talk - How to make an app.pptx" is a powerpoint slideshow that summarizes the techniques, processes, and resources I used to teach myself how to make an app from scratch.
